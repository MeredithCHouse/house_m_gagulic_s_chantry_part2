  <h1>About Chantry Island</h1>
  <p>Chantry Island is located on Lake Huron, just over a mile southwest
    of the Saugeen River mouth in Southampton, Ontario. On the island is a
    majestic Imperial Lighthouse built in the mid 1800’s, as well as the
    Keeper’s quarters and a boat house. In 1822, during a hydrographic survey,
    Captain Henry Bayfield of the Royal Navy christened the island and named it
    after his friend and British sculptor Sir Francis Chantry.</p>

  <h1>Chantry Island</h1>
  <p>Chantry Island is a glacial moraine and consists of stone above the water
     and beneath extending a mile north and a mile south of the island. These
     underwater shoals of massive granite boulders have made this area one of
     the most treacherous in the Great Lakes. There are over 50 known shipwrecks
     around the island and there are many accounts from the 1800’s and early – mid
     1900’s of these disasters and lost lives. Today, buoys and modern navigational
     tools safely guide boats through the area.</p>

     <p>The island varies in size depending on the level of Lake Huron.
       Today, with a low lake level Chantry Island is about 68 acres. In
       1986 when the water level was at the highest of the century, the island
        was only about 10 acres, causing trees on the west, north and south sides
        to drown.</p>

  <h1>The Lighthouse History</h1>
  <p>During the mid 1800’s water traffic on the Great Lakes had substantially
    increased and the colonial government called for improved navigational
    tools for the mariners on the Lake Huron. John Brown of Thorold was contracted
     to build the lighthouse on Chantry Island, as well as 10 other lighthouses
     to help sailors navigate the Lake. Because of the expense and difficulty of
     building, only six were completed. The Chantry Island Lighthouse was one of
     these completed and it was lit on April 1, 1859.</p>

     <p>The lighthouse stands 86 ft. above water level and is 80 ft. high from
       its base to the light’s center. The lantern room of the lighthouse was
       fitted with a Fresnel lens built and transported from Paris, France.
       The first fuel used was sperm whale oil and the first light was a fixed
        light, not the familiar flashing one. Other fuels used have been colza
        oil, coal oil, kerosene, acetylene and electricity. Its present-day
        flashing light is solar powered.</p>

  <h1>Federal Bird Sanctuary</h1>
  <p>In 1957 the Canadian Wildlife Service declared Chantry Island a
    Federal Migratory Bird Sanctuary to protect the migratory and
    nesting birds of the island. It is the largest Federal Migratory
    Bird Sanctuary between James Bay and Point Pelee. There are approximately
    fifty thousand birds (including chicks) on the island during the breeding
    season. It is home to nesting colonies of Great Blue Heron, Great Egret,
     Black-crowned Night-Heron, Herring Gull, Ring-billed Gull and Double-crested
     Cormorant. Water fowl such as Mallard, American Black Duck, Gadwall, Blue-winged Teal,
     Green-winged Teal, Northern Pintail, and American Wigeon are also known nesters
     on the island. Because the island is a migratory bird sanctuary, the number
     of people on the island on any given day is strictly limited and tours must
    be booked through the Chantry Island Tour Base.

    <h1>Lighthouse Restoration</h1>
<p>For almost 100 years (1859 – 1954), light keepers lived on the island to
   keep the light burning for mariners on the lake. When the lighthouse lamp
    was converted to electricity in 1954, a light keeper was no longer needed.
     The buildings were left neglected and suffered at the hands of vandals.
     The lighthouse still stood intact, but little was left of the light keeper’s
     quarters. The roof had fallen in and the walls and floors had crumbled into
     a pile of rubble in the basement.</p>

    <h1>Light Keeper's Cottage & Grounds After Restoration</h1>
<p>The Light Keeper's Cottage restoration was completed in 2001. Over 250
  volunteers put in more than 300,000 hours of labor to finish the restoration
  and ready the boat for tours. Since 2001 volunteers have restored the
  staircase of the lighthouse, built a boathouse on the island, constructed
  a replica of the original boat (which sits in the boathouse) and reconstructed
  the privy. Today the tour is operated with over 125 volunteers, whose jobs
  include island housekeepers, gardeners, tour boat captains, crew and tour
  guides, and gift shop sales and service personnel. Volunteers also install
   the portable walkways and docks every spring and remove them every fall.
   To date, there have been over 12,000 visitors to the island.</p>

   <p>Partners in the restoration, island maintenance, Chantry Island
      Tour operation and other Marine Heritage endeavors include the Town
       of Saugeen Shores, Bruce County Museum and Cultural Centre, Southampton
       Propeller Club, Chantry Island Chambettes and Saugeen Shores Chamber of
        Commerce. Their continuous support contributes to the success of the
        Marine Heritage Society goal to preserve the local marine history.</p>

  <h2>Island Docks Come Home</h2>
  <p>Friday September 16, fourteen volunteers and three boats left for the island
    at 8:30 in the morning. We spent two hours dismantling the metal walkways and
    craning them up onto the floating dock. The weather was perfect and all went well.
